# Hi I'm Danny Wu
-- -- 
I am a second year student at Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey studying Computer Technology Engineering.

Personaly I like programming and learning more about different languages on me free time, I experiment on trying new ways to make the same code just so it'll widen my knowledge and my thought process. As of now I am able to code confidently on C++, Python, MYSQL. Nevertheless I am also able to program little pieces on html and JavaScript.

I am a guy hungry for knowledge, so ebeything I see I'm curious about and try to learn by myself.
